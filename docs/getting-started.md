# Getting Started

This documentation should provide you with enough insights to understand how to use Netronome SmartNICs with `P4` programs.

- To start a new `P4` project, a [template](https://github.com/RuiCunhaM/Template-Netronome-P4) is provided and heavily recommended.

- The [`rtecli-tui`](https://github.com/RuiCunhaM/rtecli-tui) utility is also recommended to more easily interact with each NIC state.

!!! note
    Before loading programs into a SmartNIC, ensure the target host has the RTE service running.
